Create a new Java Project with just Farmer and WholeSaler class. 

Make both inherit from an interface Person.



Enhance WholeSaler class such that all it can only have a list of maximum 5 farmers.

If more than 5 farmers are added (that is when 6th farmer is added) it should throw a user defined exception 'FarmerListLimitExceededException' 



Hint: See in which method you are adding. addFarmer(Farmer f); You should throw the exception here.



Demo the above requirement in a main class.

Attach the screenshots.
