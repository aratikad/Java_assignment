Java Regex is not used to find patterns in text, it can also be used to do find and replace.

Refer Javadoc or research any other place on the internet to accomplish the following.



1. Create a new Eclipse Java project.



2. Given a file farmers.txt (you need to create this file in your project) with the following contents of ten farmers.

sameer, 25, AP, 987654321

ruby, 31,MP, 8526656675


Add other 8 farmers details in the above comma separated format(name,age,region,phone). 



3. Read the above file in your java project (using File IO classes).

Use regex to find and print if each of the farmer has a valid phone number. A phone number is valid if it is a 10 digit number.



Demo the above requirement in a main class.
